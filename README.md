Character coherence in comic books using textual and visual closure

In olden ages, when there are no movies, comics were a
good source of entertainment and still are. The difference
between a story book and a comic is that it has two modalities,
short blocks of text and an artistic image representing
the expressions and actions that makes them more interesting.
Comics can be based on true stories, fantasies or on some
messages. Given the limited number of pages, text-boxes
and few artistic images, It is in the readerâ€™s imagination to
adapt to the description given by the panels and understand
what the author wants to convey. Our project is based on
Character coherence, a task where given previous few panels
as a context and current panel with two dialogues, our deep
learning model should learn to assign the given dialogue
to correct characters. We use the COMICS dataset for
developing and testing our model. Having [1] as our baseline,
we aim to present the results on our execution of baseline, the
results of other architectures that we have proposed (VGG-
19 [3], Inception-Resnet-v2 [4] and autoencoder [5]) on the
COMICS dataset, our findings and improvements that we
suggest.
